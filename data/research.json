    "description": "We strive to develop tools for the analysis of animal behavior. Behavior is a complex reflection of an animal's goals, state and character. Thus, accurately measuring behavior is crucial for advancing basic neuroscience, as well as the study of various neural and psychiatric disorders. However, measuring behavior (from video) is also a challenging computer vision and machine learning problem.",
    "extended": "We are also passionate about wildlife conservation and are thrilled that our tools can contribute beyond Neuroscience. Our work advances machine learning and computer vision to push the state of the art for the analysis of behavior.",

This is an astonishing feat, especially considering the inherent challenges of slow hardware and the sensory and motor latencies that impede control. Understanding how the brain achieves skilled behavior is one of the core questions of neuroscience that we tackle through Modeling using Reinforcement Learning, and Control Theory.",
